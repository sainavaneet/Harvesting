Cucumber harvesting using Object Detecion
================

This repository is dedicated to the development of a cucumber harvesting
system that utilizes custom object detection with `YOLOv11`. After
detecting cucumbers, we generate specific actions for two types of
robots: the `ViperX 300s` arm robot and an `Automated Guided Vehicle`
(AGV) robot.

The primary aim of this project is to create a comprehensive `dataset`
that captures both the actions performed by the robots and the images
taken during the harvesting process. This dataset is a crucial resource
for developing and refining algorithms that will enhance future robotic
harvesting techniques.

By systematically recording a wide array of interactions and scenarios,
we not only improve the efficiency of current systems but also lay a
robust foundation for future advancements in agricultural robotics. This
initiative represents a significant step forward in automating and
optimizing the harvesting process through the integration of advanced
machine learning models and robotic technology.

## Launch

``` bash
source interbotix_ws/devel.setup.bash

cd ~/Harvesting/launch/

roslaunch robot.launch use_rviz:=false use_sim:=False # if you need in simulation use True
```

## Object Detection

The object detection files are located in the `/object_detection`
directory.

By executing the `detection_realsense.py` script, cucumbers can be
detected. We have designed the algorithm in such a way that it
determines a stable pose of the cucumber after detecting it, based on a
predefined threshold.

## 🦾TASK

- **`Robot Movement`**: The robot starts at position 1, moves along the
  path, detects cucumbers, and harvests them.

- **`Detection and Harvesting`**`:` After harvesting cucumbers at
  position 1, the robot moves to position 2, detects the next cucumber,
  and proceeds with harvesting. This pattern continues as the robot
  moves along the track.

- **`Sequential Harvesting`**`:` The robot moves sequentially from
  positions 1 to 4, harvesting cucumbers at each point along the way.

- **`Reversal of Process`**`:` Once the robot reaches the end of the
  track, at position 5, it reverses the process and moves back along the
  same path, harvesting cucumbers from position 6 to 3.

- **`Return to Start`**`:` After completing the harvesting task, the
  robot returns to its starting position at 9.

The entire task can be executed using the Python script.  

``` python
python harvest.py
```
