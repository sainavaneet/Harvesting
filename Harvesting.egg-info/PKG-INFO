Description: Cucumber harvesting using Object Detecion
        ================
        
        ## Introduction
        
        This repository is dedicated to the development of a cucumber harvesting
        system that utilizes custom object detection with `YOLOv11`. After
        detecting cucumbers, we generate specific actions for two types of
        robots: the `ViperX 300s` arm robot and an `Automated Guided Vehicle`
        (AGV) robot.
        
        The primary aim of this project is to create a comprehensive `dataset`
        that captures both the actions performed by the robots and the images
        taken during the harvesting process. This dataset is a crucial resource
        for developing and refining algorithms that will enhance future robotic
        harvesting techniques.
        
        By systematically recording a wide array of interactions and scenarios,
        we not only improve the efficiency of current systems but also lay a
        robust foundation for future advancements in agricultural robotics. This
        initiative represents a significant step forward in automating and
        optimizing the harvesting process through the integration of advanced
        machine learning models and robotic technology.
